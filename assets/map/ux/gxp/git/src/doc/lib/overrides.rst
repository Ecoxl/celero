    :synopsis: Overrides of standard Ext JS functionality.

:mod:`overrides`
================

The :mod:`overrides` folder contains script resources that use Ext JS hooks
like `Ext.util.Observable.observeClass` or `Ext.override` for global
modifications to standard components.

To use these overrides, it is sufficient to include the respective script resources in the build.
