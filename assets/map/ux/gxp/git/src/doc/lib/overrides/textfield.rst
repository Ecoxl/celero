    :synopsis: Overrides for Ext.form.TextField and subclasses.

:mod:`textfield.js`
===================




* blur_on_enter

    This override blurs textfields when the Enter key is pressed. Since many
    gxp components perform actions on a textfield's change event, using this
    override improves user experience by providing the standard behavior of
    the Enter key to confirm an input.
